# Password Strength Analyzer

A simple Python desktop app to check the strength of your passwords using Tkinter.

## Features

- Checks password strength (Weak, Moderate, Strong)
- Shows entropy (randomness) in bits
- Gives a checklist for password requirements:
  - Length (8+)
  - Lowercase
  - Uppercase
  - Numbers
  - Special Characters
- Option to show/hide password input
- Visual strength bar

## How It Works

The app analyzes your password based on length, character variety, and entropy (a measure of unpredictability). The more types of characters and the longer your password, the stronger it is.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Download `Password_strength_checker.py`.
2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```sh
   python Password_strength_checker.py
   ```
